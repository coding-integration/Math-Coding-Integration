# Coding Integration - Math / Science / Data Science

## Part 1 Coding Integration in Math - MTH1W

In this first notebook we will be exploring the following Expectations

### C1 Algebraic Expressions and Equations
- demonstrate an understanding of the development and use of algebraic concepts and of their connection to numbers, using various tools and representations

C1.5 create and solve equations for various contexts, and verify their solutions

### C2 Coding
- apply coding skills to represent mathematical concepts and relationships dynamically, and to solve problems, in algebra and across the other strands.

C2.1 use coding to demonstrate an understanding of algebraic concepts including variables, parameters, equations, and inequalities

C2.2 create code by decomposing situations into computational steps in order to represent mathematical concepts and relationships, and to solve problems

C2.3 read code to predict its outcome, and alter code to adjust constraints, parameters, and outcomes to represent a similar or new mathematical situation
